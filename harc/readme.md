# The High Altitude Receiving Center (HARC) Circle

Following the dissolution of the Colorado Springs circle, Steve and Jeremy invited two working group members to begin training to channel in late 2022. One member resigned from the group, but the other continued and worked with Steve and Jeremy at the fourth channeling intensive in Breckenridge, Colorado in June 2023. This circle is attempting to coordinate all working group members towards a single intention, a disciplined calling for peace, love, and wisdom from the Creator and Its emissaries. The goal is to think of the HARC circle as a working group project drawing upon a collective, concentrated calling to which we all contribute. This will also provide the basis for future instruments to receive training and to potentially spread this model of group seeking.
