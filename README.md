# Akasha

Akasha is a unified repository of all channelling in the lineage of the Confederation of Planets in Service to the One Infinite Creator. It is maintained by the Council for Social Memory, a non-profit organization facilitating and protecting the vibration of service-to-others 

## How it is organized

The most imporant thing is to have a discrete way of designating each channelling session. More than one session can occur on a given day, and often there are events or collections to which the session number refers. 

> circle / series / session number / year / month / day

e.g.

> HARC / Fifth Channelling Intensive / Session 5 / 2023 / 11 / 04

## The Lineage

This is an ongoing conversation, but here are examples:

- Solar Cross Foundation (Richard Miller)
- Detroit Circle
- Circle R (Clyde Trepanier)
- L/L Research
- High Altitude Receiving Center
- Mark Probert's channelled work
