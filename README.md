# Akasha

Akasha is a unified repository of all channelling in the lineage of the Confederation of Planets in Service to the One Infinite Creator.

## How it is organized

The most imporant thing is to have a discrete way of designating each channelling session. More than one session can occur on a given day, and often there are events or collections to which the session number refers. 

> year / month / day / circle / series / session number

## Which channellings count in this lineage

This is an ongoing conversation.
