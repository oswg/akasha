# Akasha

Akasha is a unified repository of all channelling in the lineage of the Confederation of Planets in Service to the One Infinite Creator. It is maintained by the [Council for Social Memory](https://councilforsocialmemory.org), a non-profit organization dedicated to resourcing the preservation of service-to-others vibratory contact with the Confederation.

## The Lineage

_I'm still researching the history of pre-LLR Confederation messages, so this is all subject to revision._

The Confederation lineage begins roughly with works like Oahspe and the channelling of Mark Probert's Inner Circle Kethra E'Da Foundation. With the popularity of George Van Tassel's UFO inspired work, we reach a fork in the lineage. Robert Short led a breakaway channelling group that eventually became Thelma B. Terrill's "Ashtar Galactic Command" organization. As a matter of tuning and polarity, we consider the Ashtar Command branch of the UFO channelling too dominated by fear-based, apocalyptic messaging to be useful in applying the Law of One to one's life and thereby better participating in one's spiritual evolution.

Meanwhile, a Detroit scene inspired by Van Tassel's work spawned a second branch that emphasized a less military sounding organization called either the "Universal Confederation" or the "Confederation of Planets in Service to the One Infinite Creator". This Confederation branch of UFO channelling includes Clyde Trepanier's work with the Detroit circle of Walt Rogers, Hal Price, and others. This work would later consolidate under the Circle R aegis. There is also Detroit expatriate Richard T. Miller's Solar Cross Foundation who operated in California, as well as the Louisville group that Hal Price started with Don Elkins of L/L Research fame. These circles operated between the early 50s and late 80s. While there is certainly some fear-based messaging in their work, there is also a clear trajectory over time across the body of work generally towards a higher, more spiritual perspective.

This Confederation channelling tradition was inherited by the Louisville-based Eftspan Foundation founded by seekers including Carla Rueckert and Don Elkins. When those two broke from Eftspan and continued channelling work that eventually included Jim McCarty, we encounter the [L/L Research](https://llresearch.org) organization and their fifty years of channelling work. Their prime achievement was the stabilization of Confederation philosophy through the information obtained via the narrow band trance contact with the sixth density social memory complex of Ra. Of equal importance was the continuation of the conscious channelling project with the Confederation through the principle of Q'uo.

After the passing of Rueckert in 2015, L/L Research began training instruments for a new channelling circle. McCarty and Rueckert-trained philosopher Dr. Steve Tyman led the instruction starting in the fall of 2016 and continuing with quarterly channelling intensives. In 2018, Tyman left L/L Research, and eventually Jeremy Weiland, another student instrument, followed him out. Most of the remaining instruments in the intensive circle constitute L/L Research's ongoing channelling circles under the supervision of McCarty. 

Tyman and Weiland joined other ex-volunteers of L/L Research in 2020 to form the [Other Selves Working Group](https://otherselvesworking.group), an experiment in a new federated model for organizing seekers. The Working Group currently maintains two channelling circles: the [High Altitude Receive Center circle](/harc) that focuses on ongoing communication with the Q'uo principle, and the [Richmond Meditation Circle](/richmond)'s ongoing contact with several fourth and fifth density social memory complexes. 

The Working Group is launching this repository in anticipation of the full establishment of a legitimate, democractic organization accountable to seekers under this philosophy to preserve the vibratory lineage, admit new channelled work that conforms to the proper protocols and criteria, expand the scope of seeking activities, and resource future seeking projects. The Council for Social Memory is the proposed name for this organization.

## Provisional criteria for integrating future channelling

One of the reasons to demonstrate the continuity and consistency of the lineage of Confederation channelling is to begin to better understand how to appraise it. As experience with the vibration of the Confederation has progressed, we have moved beyond certain topics and attitudes.

- Transient topics are minimized. By "transient" we mean "information not directly pertaining to spiritual evolution."
- All messages are peer reviewed prior to inclusion here. Polarity and accuracy are the chief concerns.
- Messages must be consonant broadly with the Law of One and Confederation philosophy
- Fear-based messages focusing on apocalyptic scenarios and drastic suggestions for life changes are not accepted
- Messages are obtained using Rueckertian Protocols
  - At least three participants working in the same physical space which has been ritualistically cleared
  - Tuning and challenging performed competently and sincerely
  - All instruments trained by an experienced instrument
