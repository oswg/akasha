# Akasha

Akasha is a unified repository of all channelling in the lineage of the Confederation of Planets in Service to the One Infinite Creator. It is maintained by the [Council for Social Memory](https://councilforsocialmemory.org), a non-profit organization facilitating and protecting the vibration of service-to-others 

## How it is organized

Each circle is designated in a sub-folder to the root. Within each circle are one or more events or collections. Within those event directories are directories for each discrete event, named like:

> YYYY-MM-DD_CIRCLE-NAME_EVENT-NAME_SESSION-NO

For example, the Oorkas via Weiland session from early 2004 would be referenced with a filename like:

> 2024-01-27_richmond_ccf_009

And within that folder would be all media pertaining to the session, whenever possible named exactly the same except with the appropriate extension.

## The Lineage

_I'm still researching the history of pre-LLR Confederation messages, so this is all subject to revision._

The Confederation lineage begins roughly with works like Oahspe and the channelling of Mark Probert's Inner Circle Kethra E'Da Foundation. With the popularity of George Van Tassel's UFO inspired work, we reach a fork in the lineage. Robert Short led a breakaway channelling group that eventually became Thelma B. Terrill's "Ashtar Galactic Command" organization. This branch of the lineage focusing on fear-based, apocalyptic messages we consider to be irretrievably compromised, and there are many instruments and circles that we could list here. 

Meanwhile, a Detroit scene inspired by Van Tassel's work spawned a second branch that focused on a deepening of the spiritual message. This includes Clyde Trepanier's channelling that would consolidate under the Circle R aegis, Richard T. Miller's Solar Cross Foundation, and the so-called Detroit Circle of Walt Rogers and Hal Price. These circles operated between the mid-50s and late 80s, and while there is some fear-based messaging in their work, it is clear to this author that a higher perspective was emerging. This perspective was inherited by the Louisville-based Eftspan Foundation, which included Carla Rueckert and Don Elkins. When those two broke from Eftspan and continued channelling work that eventually included Jim McCarty, we encounter the L/L Research organization and their fifty years of channelling work. They stabilized the messaging from the Confederation through the sixth density, narrow band, trance contact with Ra.

After the passing of Rueckert in 2015, L/L Research started training new instruments for a new channelling circle. Two instruments, one instructor and one student, eventually left the circle to form their own sites for contact with the Confederation. They work with several other seekers under the rubric of the Other Selves Working Group, the creators of this repository, and presently maintain two channelling circles: the High Altitude Receive Center circle that focuses on ongoing communication with the Q'uo principle, and the Richmond Meditation Circle's ongoing contact with several fourth and fifth density social memory complexes. 

The Working Group plans to establish a membership-controlled non-profit organization to democratically administer the legacy of this lineage stretching nearly two centuries. The chief aim of such an organization woudl be to exercise responsible stewardship of these messages, offering educational and financial resources for research and practice of the Confederation philosophy. This would also serve as a means to initiate new instruments, found new circles, and keep the vibration behind the messages pure and as tuned as possible.

## Provisional criteria for integrating future channelling

One of the reasons to demonstrate the continuity and consistency of the lineage of Confederation channelling is to begin to better understand how to appraise it. As experience with the vibration of the Confederation has progressed, we have moved beyond certain topics and attitudes.

- Transient topics are minimized. By "transient" we mean "information not directly pertaining to spiritual evolution."
- All messages are peer reviewed prior to inclusion here. Polarity and accuracy are the chief concerns.
- Messages must be consonant broadly with the Law of One and Confederation philosophy
- Fear-based messages focusing on apocalyptic scenarios and drastic suggestions for life changes are not accepted
- Messages are obtained using Rueckertian Protocols
  - At least three participants working in the same physical space which has been ritualistically cleared
  - Tuning and challenging performed competently and sincerely
  - All instruments trained by an experienced instrument
