I am Hatonn. In love and light I greet you as I speak directly from K.O.R. My brothers, my following remarks you will find quite interesting. I am about to tell you a little story. I hope you are able to grasp its significance. 

My brothers, men have traversed the corridors of time. All speak of them. The greatest quest of all who speak is to gain awareness and at-oneness with the single omnipotent source of all, the spirit of our Creator. Towards this relationship do all men everywhere in the universe strive. 

We observe the upward gropings of man's divine consciousness on the ever-ascending spiral, the soul ever seeking its greatest attainment, its reunion with its divine source. Incarnation after incarnation is experienced in this compelling desire to again be present with its source. The soul spiral ever ascending beckons on with a glow of increasing radiance as we progress each step closer to our goal. 

We, your brothers in space, physical beings even as you, recognize this same urge, aware even as we are of the higher and mightier beings who no longer have need of this physical body. Even we have only reached the edge of understanding. It is with a compelling desire that we progress. We are faced with the blinding light of a radiance of such magnificence that it awes even we. 

In speaking of this One, my brothers, whom we refer to as our Greatest One, it could be synonymous with the One you call God. In examining the writings of your Holy Word, I have just come across a passage which I believe could be interpreted to a much greater degree of understanding. As I mention it, I am quite sure it will come into your mind. "Yea, though I walk in the valley of darkness, I fear no evil, for thy love and thy light, they comfort me. And all of my days shall be spent in looking about and viewing the grandeur of thy will, O Radiant One."

It seems I have joined several of your groups together. My brothers, it is this quality which permeates the universe and raises man above the creatures, this magical being. Can it not be said that his presence accounts for all that is? A greater love than man's own is always available if but asked for. 

It is recorded that these things should come about. Man's awareness conceived in love and acquired by experience, and so it shall be. May our thoughts turn ever toward thee, O Radiant One, and it shall come to pass. And now among these words shall you find peace, and it must be realized that we are only reflections of a purer source. In thee, O Radiant One, we commend ourselves. 

Now, my brothers, after my ample rambling, the story that I mentioned. It carries a great deal of significance. Listen well. I read to you now from the writings handed down to our people. 

"And it shall come about that in the last days the earth shall be filled with trembling, and from the heavens a radiance shall burst forth, and then arrayed in splendor shall the host arrive. Great and shining craft shall bear _(inaudible)_ them both, and peace on Shan, the Earth, shall reign. And it will be said, surely in all of our time have so many been so fortunate to witness the angel. For it is upon this day that the earth shall rejoice, and in the midst of this rejoicing suddenly the sun's light will be dimmed, and at this time shall the people kneel and give thanks. And by their humbleness shall they receive the great white light which shall issue forth from the heavens and engulf them." 

Korton here. It is imperative that we discontinue. Till we speak again, I Korton, bid you the great white light. Adonai, you may discontinue.
