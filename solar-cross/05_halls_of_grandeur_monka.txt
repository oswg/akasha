Greetings, in the Light of Our Infinite One. I am Mon-ka.

That, which I would speak with you about, is entitled the Halls of Grandeur. 

The Halls of Grandeur refers, to that environment in which all Awareness,
wends its way from its dim beginnings in that which you call antiquity,
until its eventual at-oneness in the presence of that, which we shall call
the Divine. 

In those eons of time, in which this awareness we refer to, traverses this path,
which wends its way through many existences, both material and non-material, on its
way to the awareness of itself. We find that it traverses in many forms, both
carnate and incarnate, and that which is physical and that which is etheric. 

Let us for a moment examine some of the degrees of awareness, of evolvement, that
many of those present on your planet, have experienced. 

I speak now, of those upon you planet's surface, who long ago, walked with beasts
that were pre-historic in nature. In a dim, remote age. And those among you, who
trampled the fields and grasses and plains, and then across the rugged planes 
and mountains of the continents on your planet, and those which huddled in groups
for fear of extinguishing that spark of enlightenment represented by the human
evolution.

These were the beginnings. Degrees of consciousness as such for many.
In looking about at the evolution of this, in regards to that planet you call the
Earth, we see the rudimentary forms of Divine Enlightenment. The glimmerings
in Man's awareness, of a Deity that encompassed on, and impinged on, an immature
mentality. The recognition that there was a Force to be reckoned with, beyond the 
laws of that which Man knew in his environment. And so we witnessed the beginnings
of the philosophies of behavior and conduct, termed by your historians, as 
foundations of religious and moral concepts, through many eras of time,
through many mighty as well as weak civilizations. From the races and societies
of Atlantis, through those of the Pharoahs, and later through all the degrees
of religious evolution as well. This awareness of Man upon your planet, evolved
steadily towards its present state.

I am encapsulating the sequences of Time, in order to shorten this little narrative,
For though these hallways have been ones of Grandeur, in the remote moments of man's consciousness,
evolution upon your planet, we believe, is more intriguing in that yet to be experienced, in your
futures. 

People of Earth, the Halls of Grandeur which I speak of now, exist in terms of how you describe
distance. It is merely a thought away. 

As this awareness grows, the step is taken, and soon one's total awareness finds itself experiencing
all manner of new ideas, sensations, and environments. The steps, that await you, are truly the
Halls of Grandeur.

For they take you beyond the confines of that which you know at this time, and suddenly, that which you
call your Real Self, finds itself experiencing a type of freedom unknown in your present time - without
restrictions, without let us say the knowledgeable observance of certain physical laws. Consciousness,
now enters a realm where it knows the boundless intimacies of true existence! And here we find that
faculty of Man, free to travel in to dimensions unknown in the physical. 

Time, as you describe it, no longer has meaning or value. Distance as you describe it, no longer exists.
The tri-dimensional concept of physical reality fades to insignificance, for here are no dimensions. 
Here in the realms where Thought alone exists - where the mind soars - is Freedom!

A freedom so intense, so vivid in its reality, that it is difficult for your present awareness to resist
the urge to return. Here, on this level, we find a scope of awareness, an environment that is truly infinite
- or as I have mentioned - all that is capable of being conceptualized in thought, exists.

In your mind, can you imagine the joys of this awareness?
You know the freedom from that which you term 'fatigue', you sense an unbounded exhiliration in your existence,
you grasp even with the most tender and minute quantity of that which is true essence. 
You know Joys, you experience Love, and you accept Truth.

Burdened as you are in your present environment, perhaps to some there may be difficulties in comprehending this.
But to those who already have sensed this ability, they have grasped its import. And to those who will soon
stretch forth their awareness and accept it - this is what, partially, is the fulfillment. 

In this realm where perhaps we might speak on a more personal level, with each degree of consciousness, where
we might truly share our thoughts - we would then have no need for our present menthod of communication. 
Shoudl we desire, we could transport ourselves mentally, through the fabric of all space, to a destination anywhere
within the many Halls of Our Infinite One's Existence.

Would this not be a goal worth seeking? And an attainment worth your efforts?

Not as a means of escape from that which you endure in your present life.
But as a means of solving the mystery of the real You in the physical world. 
I speak not of some paradise where thought may flee to- a diferent Reality - but I speak of a realm
where Thought might in truth, fullness and complete honesty, know the problems
and solutions that affect your Earth. 

In these Halls of Grandeur, all that the mind can conceive, of Beauty, of Love and of Primary Importance,
Intelligence and Light exists! I do not give you these words or thoughts idly, people of Earth!
This level of awareness *is* Reality!

More distinctly real than that which you presently experience, even at this moment. 

Many of you have formed an idea, a concept regarding that which you call your tri-dimensional world of physical
reality, and you say as I have often noted, that it is the world of Illusion.

If this be so, than the level of awareness that I have just described, is of greater Reality. 

The thought comes from many minds upon your planet, as to how one accomplishes this transition,
from one level of awareness to another, with the ability to return at will. 

I could burden you unnecessarily, with countless techniques that have been handed down to you from
the pages of your antiquity, I could give you explanations and rationalizations, that some upon your
planet would accept, and on the other hand, express to you, why others will not be able to accomplish this.

The reasons, the explanations, are legion.

I would, in their place, offer this for your consideration. To those upon your planet who really
attempt to know, to those who can grasp even minutely, the Essence of Thought, to these the Halls of Grandeur
are an open path. Lest you think that my words are as vague as other concepts offered to you in the past,
I would remind you that I have merely stated, if you could but glimpse the knowledge,
these Halls would be yours.

You ask which qualifications does that which we call 'Man', need, to experience this?
There has been only one qualification of prime importance, since the beginning of evolution
of your degree of consciousness and awareness, and that is: 
to seek, to study, to know, with certainty, the knowledge that this awareness exists.

These are the three!

True, not everyone can accept that which I have stated. 
But to the vast majority to whom I speak, it is not only a probability, it is a distinct
possibility, and only needs the three ingredients that I have mentioned. 

If you would accept this, you would find the answers to that which troubles your world. 
Our mission, people of Earth, is not the execution of Our Infinite One's work.
It is one of support, to Our Infinite One's Mission. 

Therefore, if there be those among you who have considered, that some day in your futures,
we would be the ones to stand upon your surface and end the chaotic madness possessing the minds
of men upon your planet, may I humbly request -- that that thought be reevaluated.

If the planet Earth is to survive the birth-pains of its emergence into that which your
peoples have described as a new age of existence - then that survival, my brothers of Earth,
will be because of your knowledge of Our Infinite One's purpose, and of your true self.

In these Halls of Grandeur, we, your brothers in space, and those worlds about you - have eagerly
waited since the dawn of many ages past - the reunion we have spoken of often.

We still exercise that which you call Patience. We do not grow weary, we only grow more
concerned, at your lack of concern, for the blindness, the lack of awareness, is not of any
Being's intent, nor of any one's intent. It is your blind acceptance of limitation: your own intent.

Perhaps you think I place undue concern upon this matter. 

Of all of the planets within this our solar system, there is a special affinity and gratitude
that I feel in connection with your planet. This is not of a sentimental nature. It goes far
deeper than that. It is a realization that there dwells within the minds, the hearts, and the
emotions of men and women individually upon your planet, the knowledge and the certainty
of the True Path.

This I may be sympathetic with. This I can entirely place myself in rapport with. 

And therefore, when those monitors upon our craft, receive those emanations of Thought from the minds
of those upon your surface who earnestly, rightfully, sincerely seek a greater Awareness, then:
we are thrilled. For we recognize another light flickering in a vast sea of darkness. That illumination
can only be brightened by your efforts: You, to whom I speak. 


Think well upon that life which you are leading. Think well upon those missions you feel destined to 
accomplish. And know that those which are of greatest benefit to the attainment of your individual awareness
and enlightenment, are those which are the most harmonious with the intent of the Infinite. 

None of you, to whom I speak, are so gross in your manifestation of divine intelligence, that you do not
have a glimmering within your Being, of that which is Our Divine One's Concept. 

Therefore, in complete integrity, I can only submit to the intelligent minds upon your planet's surface,
these thoughts.

Again, know that which you are. Stand with the dignity of that which you represent. 
Grasp, with a firm hold, the sanctity of Man within each of you. And recognize it, in those who
join you in your effort. 

And it will not be long until we truly have that often repeated privilege, we have expressed. 
That of greeting you as True Sons of Light. 

May Our Infinite One's Light be with all of You. May His Radiance illuminate the darkness of your thoughts
and your world, and may I again have the privilege of speaking with all of you. 

My brothers and sisters of Earth. 

In His Radiance, I depart now. Adonai, my brothers, I am Monka. Adonai.
